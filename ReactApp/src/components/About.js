          <p>As you have figured out by now my name is Terry Young! I am a DevOps Engineer who has been in the IT field for over 7 years now. I started my career out as a desktop support engineer for General Dynamics and have been on and
               off government and private contracts since. For the last 4 years I have been working in DevOps and I have been bettering my skill set by getting certificates (which you will see on another page!), 
               learning and using coding languages (also what you will see on other pages) for automation and app design (mobile and web). 
              Enough about me! check out what else I have to offer through the site! Hopefully you enjoy what you read!</p>
